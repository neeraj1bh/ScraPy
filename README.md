A Web Scraper to send emails if price decrease for Products on Amazon.

Requirements
============

This script has been developed in Python 3.8, so you'll need python3.

As this script uses various python packages, I've created a requirement file so
that you just have to type:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This will find and install the needed packages

Usage
=====
In the scraper.py file. 
Enter the amazon URL.
Enter your user agent here 'Search google for My User Agent'.
and Enter the price drop after you want to be notifed.
after that run the file.
